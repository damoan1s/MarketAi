# MarketAI — Institutional Market Intelligence Engine

MarketAI is an advanced financial analysis system designed to decode market intent, 
detect institutional behavior, and synchronize multi-market data (spot + futures + liquidity)
to forecast macro and micro market movements with exceptional precision.

This project is built on four fundamental roots:

1. Root 1 — Market Structure Engine  
2. Root 2 — Smart Indicators & Absorption Logic  
3. Root 3 — Multi-Market Intent Engine (Spot/Futures Delta)  
4. Root 4 — Decision & Execution Engine

MarketAI is not a traditional retail-indicator system.  
It is a high-level analytics engine built around market DNA principles:
Absorption → Exhaustion → Divergence → Reversal → Expansion.

## 🧠 Core Features

- Market Structure Engine  
  Detects swing points, deviations, slope shifts, and institutional displacement.

- Smart Indicators  
  Absorption zones, imbalance scanners, liquidity pressure detection, and divergence engines.

- Multi-Market Synchronization  
  Compares futures vs spot behavior, delta shifts, liquidity flow differences.

- Intent Engine  
  Determines true market direction using rulesets, microstructure filters, and discrepancy analysis.

- Decision Engine  
  Produces trading signals for swing, day trading, and scalping models.

- Execution Layer  
  Webhook-based order execution, position management, and risk controls.

## 🚀 Vision

MarketAI is designed to scale into a full institutional intelligence system capable of:

- Predicting market intent  
- Automating swing/day/scalping execution  
- Synchronizing liquidity across markets  
- Providing professional-grade analytics  

This README will evolve as the system matures.
